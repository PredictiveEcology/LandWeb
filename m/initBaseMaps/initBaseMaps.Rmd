# Overview

This module crops and reprojects maps to the a study region. 
It is based on the crop module developed by McIntire in 2015. 

The present version is faciitate testing of the LandWEB neutral fire model.

All the objects to be processes are assumed to already exist in the sim list, having been specified as inputs in any model containing this module.

We assume that a Canada Landcover 2005 \cite{latifovic2008} map will exists as 
**sim$LCC05**  and that shapefile **sim$shpStudyRegion**  will exist to delineate the study region.


# Events

There is only an init event that executes the gis operations.
