#' Core Burn function for Andison Fire Module
#'
#' @description The main function for the Andison Fire Module. See details.
#'
#' @param landscape A RasterLayer. This only provides the extent and resolution for the fire spread algorithm.
#' @param startCells A numeric vector indicating the indices on the \code{landscape} where the fires
#'                   will start with 100\% certainty.
#' @param fireSizes A numeric vector indicating the final size of each of the fires. Must be same length as
#'                  \code{startCells}.
#' @param nActiveCells1 A numeric vector of length 2. These are cutoffs above and below each of which different values
#'                      of \code{spawnNewActive} are used. See details.
#' @param spawnNewActive A numeric vector of length 4. These are the probabilities of creating spreading to 2 neighbours
#'                       instead of the 1 default neighbour, each time step. The 4 values are for 4 different fire
#'                       size conditions. See details.
#' @param sizeCutoffs A numeric vector of length 2, in hectares. These are 2 size thresholds that affect which
#'                    \code{spawnNewActive} probabilities are used. See details.
#'
#' @details
#' This algorithm is a modified contagious cellular automaton. The algorithm is as follows:
#'
#' @section Algorithm:
#'
#' \subsection{Core}{
#' Each fire starts at a single pixel, \code{startCells} and will spread, i.e,. visit and convert
#' from a 0 to the fire id number. It will iteratively
#' spread until the number of cells visited is equal to \code{floor(fireSizes)}.
#' }
#' \subsection{Adjustments due to current fire size and number of active pixels}{
#'
#' That can vary too, but it gets a bit complicated, so use that for now.
#' Spawning probability was originally set at 13%, but created problems with very large and very small
#'  fires, so over time has been adjusted to vary depending on a) number of active “firelets” (NF) and b) fire size (FS):
#'   -         If NF>=10 and <36 and FS <20,000 ha then P = 20%
#'   -         If NF>36 and FS <8,000 ha, P=11%
#'   -         If  NF<36 and FS >20,000 ha, P=26%
#'   -         If NF<10 then P=46%
#' These rule create more heterogeneity in the pattern of burning.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Fire jumping}:
#' If the fire has not reached its target size, it will try to pick new neighbours among
#' the 8 immediate neighbours up to 4 times. If it still did not find enough neighbours, then 
#' it will jump or “spot” up to 4 pixels away. It will then repeat the previous 2 stages again
#' once (i.e., 4 neighbours, 1 jump, 4 neighbours, 1 jump), then it will stop, unable to achieve
#' the desired fireSize.
