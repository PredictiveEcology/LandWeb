# Overview

This is a simple data preparation module that creates a "burnable" landscape.

Reclassify `sim$LCC05` into a binary `rstFlammable` where 1 codes for nonflammable cells, 0 codes for flammable.
The classes are derived from the legend of Land Cover Map of Canada 2005, metadata v1_2 (2008).

Use `sim$shpStudyRegion` to generate `rstBurnProb` by rasterising the spatial polygon attribute `fireReturnInterval`.

# Events

There is only an init event which does the reclassification and rasterising, placeing the results in the `sim` environment
