# Overview

This is a simple data preparation module that creates a "burnable" landscape.

Reclassify **sim$LCC05** into a binary **rstFlammable** where 1 codes for nonFlammable cells, 0 codes for flammable. The classes are derived from the legend of Land Cover Map of Canada 2005, metadata v1_2 (2008)

Use **sim$shpStudyRegion** to generate **rstBurnProb** by rasterising the spatial polygon attribute **fireReturnInterval**.


# Events

There is only an init event which does the reclassification and rasterising, placeing the results in the **sim** environment
