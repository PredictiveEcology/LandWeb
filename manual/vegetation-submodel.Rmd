# Vegetation submodel {-}

The LandR ecosystem of SpaDES modules has a variety of data and/or calibration modules that are used to obtain and pre-process input data, as well as estimate input parameters required by the core forest landscape simulation module *Biomass_core*.
These modules are presented in the subsequent chapters.
